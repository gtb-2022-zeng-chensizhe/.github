## Hi there, welcome to my GitHub

My name is 曾陈思哲/Chensizhe Zeng, and you can call me John/Jonathan

I studied Material Chemistry at the Beijing Institute of Technology when I was an undergraduate student and got a Master degree of Informational Technology at the University of New South Wales in Australia.
I am glad to meet you and hope we could learn a lot from each other~.
